Grab a copy of the attached code. Put in in a project called "sorting". Over the next few days, we'll look at selection, insertion, and merge sorts. You won't have to write a sorting algorithm on the exam, but you should be familiar with them as you may need to trace similar logic in multiple-choice problems.

        sort(nums);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums));
